            <ul>
                <li>Created procedural level generation system using Dijkstra's Algorithm to generate a path through two corners of a level.</li>
                <li>Developed two characters, one meele and the other shooting, implementing unique abilities, animations, sounds, and more.</li>
                <li>Implemented over 15 items that either augment traits of the player or create new advantages for the player.</li>
                <li>Created and implemented every art asset in the game.</li>

                <li>Engineered abilities: Satchel jump, similar to Razeâ€™s from valorant, a teleport blade inspired by the ability in apex legends, and a dash which launches the player in their desired direction procedural level generation system using Dijkstra's Algorithm to generate a path through two corners of a level.</li>
                <li>Created ability manager: Gameplay system letting players hold two abilities in their right and left hand respectively. Inspired by the card system in neon white while taking visual inspiration from post void.</li>
                <li>Implemented obstacles: Implemented Balloon, inspired from Neon White, Boost panel, Slingshot, turret, spikes, and more to come.</li>
                <li>Wrote level design documentation with game design pillars to assist other developers in crafting levels.</li>

            <h3>Defenders of the Eldritch Order</h3>
            <p>An RTS game where you survive on an island full of dangerous bugs by managing sand troops and buildings.</p>
            <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> Unity, C#, Base-Building Mechanics</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Constructed building decay: Buildings that are outside of a range of an outpost building would slowly decay and die over time. This encourages players to construct bases thoughtfully.</li>
                <li>Outpost building. A building that would serve as an anchor for other buildings and troops. This building would allow players to set up smaller bases, where buildings would be safe, and troops would be healed.</li>
                <li>Implemented visuals and animations that made the game prettier and gave players important information about the range of certain buildings. Additionaly, created cutscenes to set up the story.</li>
